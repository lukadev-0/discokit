# Exported Packages

The `discokit` package re-exports several other packages, they can then be imported
through `discokit/<name>`.

For example, the [`@discokit/rest`](/reference/discokit-rest) package
can be imported as follows:

```js
import { ... } from "discokit/rest";
```

<Callout>
  **For TypeScript Users**\
  The `"moduleResolution"` compiler option must be set to either `node16`,
  `nodenext` or `bundler` for the import to work.
</Callout>

The following packages are re-exported:

- [@discokit/rest](/reference/discokit-rest) as `discokit/rest`
- [@discokit/bitfields](/reference/discokit-bitfields) as `discokit/bitfields`
- [@discokit/types](/reference/discokit-types) as `discokit/types`
